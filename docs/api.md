# Mazewire's APIs

Mazewire's external APIs are designed primarily around REST principles. Instances of a Mazewire
cluster communicate among themselves using gRPC. The developer-oriented documentation about this
internal usage of gRPC is given in the [internal-api.md](../pkg/api/internal-api.md) file.
